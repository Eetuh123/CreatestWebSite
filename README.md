# **Portfolio Website & Gym Program Maker**

## **Introduction**
Welcome to my portfolio site! Initially, this started as a practice environment for Vue and Laravel. However, as my inspiration grew, I began integrating different kinds of projects. Currently, it combines a portfolio and a Gym Program Maker, with plans to separate them into individual projects later on. There was also an algorithm visualizer in development, but I've decided to reserve that for a separate project in the future.

 ## **Features**
**Portfolio Section:** This section is a straightforward portfolio where I showcase my projects, share information about myself, and provide contact details.

**Gym Program Maker:** Initially planned as a simple tool for creating week-long gym programs and highlighting the muscles worked each day, this feature has evolved significantly. It now includes training blocks, daily exercises, and the ability to share exercises and entire programs. There's still much to do, and I'm even considering developing Android and iOS apps for it.

 ## **Technologies Used**
This project utilizes Laravel, Vue, Tailwind, and Vite.
